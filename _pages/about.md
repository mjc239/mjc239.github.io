I am a Data Scientist in the Alpha Strategies team at [Nomura](https://www.nomura.com/), 
where I was previously a Quantitative Researcher in the Fixed Income division, specialising
in credit.  I completed my PhD in 2018 at Queen Mary University of London in Mathematics,
 where my [thesis](https://mjc239.github.io/assets/PhDThesis.pdf) was on characterisations
  of black hole spacetimes in general relativity. Prior to my PhD, I studied Mathematics 
  at the University of Cambridge.
