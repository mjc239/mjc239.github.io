I am a Data Scientist in the Alpha Strategies team at [Nomura](https://www.nomura.com/), 
where I was previously a Quantitative Researcher in the Fixed Income division, specialising
in credit.  I completed my PhD in 2018 at Queen Mary University of London in Mathematics,
 where my [thesis](assets/PhDThesis.pdf) was on characterisations of black hole solutions 
 in general relativity. Prior to my PhD, I studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
