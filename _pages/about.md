I am a Data Science Manager at [C3 AI](https://c3.ai/), developing data science 
solutions for customers in a variety of industries. Previously, I was a Data 
Scientist in the Alpha Strategies team at [Nomura](https://www.nomura.com/), 
where I was also a Quantitative Researcher in the Fixed Income division (Credit). I 
completed my PhD in 2018 at Queen Mary University of London in Mathematics,
 where my [thesis](https://mjc239.github.io/assets/PhDThesis.pdf) was on 
 characterisations of black hole spacetimes in general relativity. Prior to my 
 PhD, I studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
