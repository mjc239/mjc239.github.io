A collection of posts, using a statistical approach to analyse the game of darts - in particular, looking at:
- The best ways to maximise score and come up with winning strategies
- Analysing the Quadro board, a variant of the standard board used briefly in the 90s
- Constructing tools to help players optimise their game.
