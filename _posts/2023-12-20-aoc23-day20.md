## Part 1

In the first part of [today's puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20), we are given details of a collection of __communication modules__, which are able to send __high__ and __low pulses__ to each other. Each module is one of a number of different types, each with a different behaviour:

- Flip flop module: defaults to Off, and has the following behaviour when receiving a pulse:

| Setting | High pulse | Low pulse |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| On | Nothing | Turn __off__, send __low__ pulse |
| Off | Nothing | Turn __on__ , send __high__ pulse |

- Conjunction module: defaults to remembering low pulse from each input, and then after receiving a new pulse and updating its memory:

| Memory | Receive pulse |
| :-: | :-: |
| High for all inputs | Send __low__ pulse |
| Low for at least one input | Send __high__ pulse |

- Broadcaster module:

| High pulse | Low pulse |
| :-: | :-: |
| Send __high__ pulse | Send __low__ pulse |


Let's create some classes which will represent each of the communcation modules, and handle the receiving and transmission of pulses. Each will be an example of a `Module`, which provides the abstract base class for all the other modules:


```python
class Module(ABC):
    
    def __init__(self, connected):
        self.connected = connected
        super().__init__()
    
    @abstractmethod
    def process_pulse(self, pulse):
        raise NotImplementedError()
        
    @abstractmethod
    def reset(self):
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

The following `dataclass` will track each pulse, remembering the pulse type (low or high) as well as the source and target modules for the pulse:


```python
@dataclass
class Pulse:
    pulse_type: str
    origin: Module
    destination: Module
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'{self.origin} -{self.pulse_type}-> {self.destination}'
```

First, the flip-flop module:


```python
class FlipFlop(Module):
    
    def __init__(self, name, connected):
        super().__init__(connected)
        self.name = name
        self.state = False
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'flipflop_{self.name}'
    
    def process_pulse(self, pulse):
        # Check that pulse is coming to this module
        assert pulse.destination == self.name
        
        # Do nothing if high pulse
        if pulse.pulse_type == 'high':
            return []
        
        # If low pulse, send low/high pulse
        # and flip module state
        elif pulse.pulse_type == 'low':
            pulses = [
                Pulse(pulse_type='low' if self.state else 'high',
                      origin=self.name,
                      destination=module)
                for module in self.connected
            ]
            self.state = not self.state
            return pulses
        
    def reset(self):
        self.state = False
```

Next, the `Conjunction` module, which has a memory of the pulses from each input module stored as a `dict`. This is initially empty, so when an instance of `Conjunction` is created, this memory needs to be populated with `low` values for any module that has the potential to send a pulse to it.


```python
class Conjunction(Module):
    
    def __init__(self, name, connected):
        super().__init__(connected)
        self.name = name
        
        # Initially empty - needs to be
        # populated on initialization!
        self.states = {}
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'conj_{self.name}'
    
    def process_pulse(self, pulse):
        # Check that pulse is coming to this module
        assert pulse.destination == self.name
        
        # Update module memory
        origin = pulse.origin
        self.states[origin] = pulse.pulse_type
        
        # Sent pulse depends on memory of all inputs
        if all([pulse_type == 'high' for pulse_type in self.states.values()]):
            out_pulse_type = 'low'
        else:
            out_pulse_type = 'high'
            
        # Send pulses to all connected modules
        return [
            Pulse(pulse_type=out_pulse_type,
                  origin=self.name,
                  destination=module)
                for module in self.connected
        ]
    
    def reset(self):
        self.states = {state: 'low' for state in self.states}
```

The `Broadcaster` module transmits any input pulse to all of the connected output modules:


```python
class Broadcaster(Module):
    
    def __init__(self, name, connected):
        super().__init__(connected)
        self.name = name
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'{self.name}'
    
    def process_pulse(self, pulse):
        # Broadcast pusle to all connected modules
        return [
            Pulse(
                pulse_type=pulse.pulse_type,
                origin=self.name,
                destination=module)
            for module in self.connected
        ]
    
    def reset(self):
        pass
```

Finally, any module not recognised as a flip-flop, conjunction or broadcaster is classed as an `UntypedModule`, which can receive pulses but never transmits any:


```python
class UntypedModule(Module):
    
    def __init__(self, name, connected):
        super().__init__(connected)
        self.name = name
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'{self.name}'
    
    def process_pulse(self, pulse):
        # No pulses transmitted
        return []
    
    def reset(self):
        pass
```

For each row in the input file, the first character(s) determines the type of module (`%` = flip-flop, `#` = conjunction, `broadcaster` = broadcaster, anything else = untyped). So loop over all of the rows, creating a `Module` object of some kind for each of them. There may also be modules which do not have their own rows, but are defined in the connected modules of another row - this needs to be checked after the first pass over the rows, and while doing this the `states` for all the `Conjunction` modules can also be properly initialised.


```python
def process_input(input_lines):
    modules = {}
    
    for line in input_lines:
        module_string, conn_string = line.split(' -> ')
        connected = conn_string.split(', ')
        # Flip-flops
        if module_string[0] == '%':
            name = module_string[1:]
            modules[name] = FlipFlop(name, connected)
            
        # Conjunctions
        elif module_string[0] == '&':
            name = module_string[1:]
            modules[name] = Conjunction(name, connected)
            
        # Broadcasters
        elif module_string == 'broadcaster':
            modules['broadcaster'] = Broadcaster('broadcaster', connected)
            
        # Untyped
        else:
            modules[module_string] = UntypedModule(module_string, connected)
    
    # Check for any uninitialised modules
    # and in the meantime initialise the
    # states for Conjunction modules
    unfound_modules = {}
    for module_name, module in modules.items():
        for out in module.connected:
            
            if out not in modules:
                # Uninitialised module
                unfound_modules[out] = UntypedModule(out, [])
                
            elif isinstance(modules[out], Conjunction):
                # Conjunction module - add to state
                modules[out].states[module_name] = 'low'
                
    return {**modules, **unfound_modules}
```


```python
modules = process_input(input_20)
```

The first part of the puzzle asks to find the number of low and high pulses transmitted between the modules, when the button is pressed $1000$ times. Here are a couple of helper function, that allow us to track these:
- `reset_modules` = used to reset the modules to their initial states (flip-flops back to Off, conjunctions back to 'low' for all source modules)
- `send_n_pulses` = transmits $n$ low pulses to the broadcaster module, and counts the total number of low and high pulses subsequently transmitted. Each time, a low pulse is transmitted to the broadcaster module, and all subsequent pulses are sent and resolved before the next press of the button. To handle, this we can use a priority queue - specifically, using a `deque` from the standard Python module `collections`. When a pulse is created, it is added to the end of the priority queue; once all modules have processed a particular pulse, a new pulse can be taken from the front of the queue. In this way, all currently existing pulses are handled before any subsequently created pulses.


```python
def reset_modules(modules):
    # Reset modules to their initial states
    for module_string in modules:
        modules[module_string].reset()

def send_n_pulses(modules, n, reset=True, print_pulses=False):
    # Hit the button n times, transmitting n low pulses
    # to the broadcaster module. Count the total number 
    # of low and high pulses transmitted
    
    # Reset all modules if necessary
    if reset:
        reset_modules(modules)
        
    n_pulses = {'low': 0, 'high': 0}
    for _ in range(n):
        
        # Use a double-ended queue to track the pulses
        pulses = deque()
        
        # Transmit pulse from button
        pulses.append(Pulse('low', 'button', 'broadcaster'))
        n_pulses['low'] += 1
        
        while len(pulses) > 0:
            # Take pulse from the front of the queue
            pulse = pulses.popleft()
            if print_pulses:
                print(pulse)

            # Process pulse and create new pulses
            # to add to end of priority queue
            module = modules[pulse.destination]
            out_pulses = module.process_pulse(pulse)
            for out_pulse in out_pulses:
                n_pulses[out_pulse.pulse_type] += 1
                pulses.append(out_pulse)
                
    return n_pulses
```

Let's test this out on the provided test examples:


```python
test_1 = [
    'broadcaster -> a, b, c',
    '%a -> b',
    '%b -> c',
    '%c -> inv',
    '&inv -> a'
]

test_1_modules = process_input(test_1)

_ = send_n_pulses(test_1_modules, 1, print_pulses=True)
```

    button -low-> broadcaster
    broadcaster -low-> a
    broadcaster -low-> b
    broadcaster -low-> c
    a -high-> b
    b -high-> c
    c -high-> inv
    inv -low-> a
    a -low-> b
    b -low-> c
    c -low-> inv
    inv -high-> a
    

This matches the expected sequence of pulses for this first example. For the second example, a sequence of 4 button presses completes a cycle:


```python
test_2 = [
    'broadcaster -> a',
    '%a -> inv, con',
    '&inv -> b',
    '%b -> con',
    '&con -> output'
]

test_2_modules = process_input(test_2)

for i in range(4):
    print(f'\n====== Press {i+1} ======\n')
    send_n_pulses(test_2_modules, 1, reset=False, print_pulses=True)
```

    
    ====== Press 1 ======
    
    button -low-> broadcaster
    broadcaster -low-> a
    a -high-> inv
    a -high-> con
    inv -low-> b
    con -high-> output
    b -high-> con
    con -low-> output
    
    ====== Press 2 ======
    
    button -low-> broadcaster
    broadcaster -low-> a
    a -low-> inv
    a -low-> con
    inv -high-> b
    con -high-> output
    
    ====== Press 3 ======
    
    button -low-> broadcaster
    broadcaster -low-> a
    a -high-> inv
    a -high-> con
    inv -low-> b
    con -low-> output
    b -low-> con
    con -high-> output
    
    ====== Press 4 ======
    
    button -low-> broadcaster
    broadcaster -low-> a
    a -low-> inv
    a -low-> con
    inv -high-> b
    con -high-> output
    

Finally, we can press the button for the full set of modules $1000$ times and count the number of pulses; the final answer to submit is the product of the numbers of low and high pulses:


```python
n_pulses = send_n_pulses(modules, 1000)
n_pulses['low']*n_pulses['high']
```




    730797576



So the answer to part 1 is: __730797576__.

## Part 2

In part 2 of this puzzle, we are asked to find the minimum number of button presses required to send a low pulse to the `rx` module. After closer examination of the structure of the various modules (see the page at the end of this post!), we can identify the purpose of each of them; the `clusters` dict splits the modules up into various functional groups, and the visualization using `graphviz` helps to demonstrate what is going on:


```python
# Group the modules into different clusters
clusters = {
    'chain_1': ['hx', 'xq', 'rm', 'tp', 'kh', 'qc', 'xh', 'vm', 'jm', 'cq', 'tg', 'fb'],
    'chain_2': ['kb', 'cv', 'vx', 'pt', 'qq', 'rz', 'tz', 'kn', 'gg', 'cp', 'rd', 'xk'],
    'chain_3': ['nj', 'kp', 'xx', 'vp', 'sj', 'mt', 'mx', 'rv', 'rr', 'bq', 'xb', 'gr'],
    'chain_4': ['xr', 'qv', 'gx', 'vh', 'qn', 'lz', 'xv', 'zk', 'lv', 'mj', 'hb', 'vj'],
    'rx_cluster': ['rx', 'gh', 'rk', 'cd', 'zf', 'qx']
}
rest = ['broadcaster', 'xz', 'jj', 'bz', 'gf']
```


```python
# Plot the modules to visualize the structure
from graphviz import Digraph
fontsize='30'
g = Digraph('G', filename='day20.gv', format='png')

for name, module in modules.items():
    for conn in module.connected:
        for cluster_name, cluster in clusters.items():
            if name in cluster and conn in cluster:
                with g.subgraph(name=f'cluster_{cluster_name}') as c:
                    c.edges([(name, conn)]) 
        if name in rest or conn in rest:
            g.edge(name, conn)
            
    if isinstance(module, FlipFlop):
        g.node(name, style='filled', color='lightblue', fontsize=fontsize, group='flipflop')
    if isinstance(module, Conjunction):
        g.node(name, style='filled', color='orange', fontsize=fontsize)
    if isinstance(module, Broadcaster):
        g.node(name, style='filled', color='pink', fontsize=fontsize)
    if isinstance(module, UntypedModule):
        g.node(name, style='filled', color='yellow', fontsize=fontsize)
    
    for cluster_name in clusters:
        with g.subgraph(name=f'cluster_{cluster_name}') as c:
            c.attr(peripheries='0')
        
g.view()
```


| ![Module diagram](/assets/images/day20_diagram.png) |
|:--:|
| Diagram visualizing the structure of the modules. The `FlipFlop`s are in blue, `Conjunctions` in orange, `Broadcaster` in pink, and the final output module `nx` is in yellow. | 



Let's break down what is going on here:
- The different types of modules are colour coded:
    - `FlipFlop` = blue
    - `Conjunction` = orange
    - `Broadcaster` = pink
    - `UntypedModule` = yellow


- The `rx` module is the only `UntypedModule`. It only receives pulses from the `gh` module, which is a `Conjunction` module. This means that a low pulse will only be sent to `rx` when all the inputs to `gh` are 'high'.

- There are 4 modules which `gh` receives pulses from: `rk`, `cd`, `zf` and `qx`. Each of these are `Conjunction` modules, with a single input module (`jj`, `gf`, `xz` and `bz` respectively). A `Conjunction` module with a single input effectively acts as a NOT gate, switching low pulses for high pulses (and vice versa). Therefore, `gh` transmits a low pulse only when each of `jj`, `gf`, `xz` and `bz` have sent low pulses.

- There are 4 groups, each containing 12 `FlipFlop` modules connected in sequence. Each group has an associated `Conjunction` module (one of `jj`, `gf`, `xz` or `bz`), which outputs to all of the modules in the group. Some (but not all) of the `FlipFlop` modules also output to the `Conjunction` module.

- The only `Broadcaster` module, which receives the inital low pulse from the button, is connected to the first `FlipFlop` in each of the groups. Each time the button is pressed, this module will transmit a new low pulse to the first `FlipFlop` in each group.

- When each chain of `FlipFlop`s receives a new low pulse, it propogates along the chain, updating the on/off states of each module. The key insight is that the on/off states of the modules in the chain represent a binary number, and each low pulse increments this number by 1:
| Pulse/state | Binary arithmetic |
| :--: | :--: |
| Off -> On, send high pulse | 0 -> 1, no carry digit |
| On -> Off, send low pulse | 1 -> 0, carry digit to next module |
| Receive low pulse | Carried 1 received |
| Receive high pulse | No carry received |

Let's test this by sending a few pulses into each chain, and looking at the binary number recorded on each chain:


```python
def binary_states(modules, names):
    ret = ''
    for name in names:
        mod = modules[name]
        ret += '1' if mod.state else '0'
    return ret
```


```python
reset_modules(modules)
for i in range(8):
    send_n_pulses(modules, 1, reset=False, print_pulses=False)
    print(f'======= Press {i+1} ======')
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_1']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_2']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_3']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_4']))
```

    ======= Press 1 ======
    000000000001
    000000000001
    000000000001
    000000000001
    ======= Press 2 ======
    000000000010
    000000000010
    000000000010
    000000000010
    ======= Press 3 ======
    000000000011
    000000000011
    000000000011
    000000000011
    ======= Press 4 ======
    000000000100
    000000000100
    000000000100
    000000000100
    ======= Press 5 ======
    000000000101
    000000000101
    000000000101
    000000000101
    ======= Press 6 ======
    000000000110
    000000000110
    000000000110
    000000000110
    ======= Press 7 ======
    000000000111
    000000000111
    000000000111
    000000000111
    ======= Press 8 ======
    000000001000
    000000001000
    000000001000
    000000001000
    

As shown here, each press of the button increments the count on each chain by 1.

For each chain, the associated `Conjunction` only sends high pulses (with no effect on the `FlipFlop`s), until it has received only high pulses from all of its inputs. This happens when each of the carefully chosen `FlipFlop` inputs have sent high pulses to it - i.e., they have all just been switched on. 

The first time that all of these modules are switched on simultaneously is when the incremental counter has reached the binary number with $1$s in these positions, and $0$s everywhere else. In other words, by recording the binary number defined by the chain, we find the number of button presses required to activate the `Conjunction` for the first time. Reading these numbers off the diagram for each chain:


```python
print(int('111011010001', 2))
print(int('111101101011', 2))
print(int('111111011001', 2))
print(int('111010010101', 2))
```

    3793
    3947
    4057
    3733
    

Once one of these numbers is hit, a low pulse is sent from the `Conjunction` to all of the `FLipFlop`s in the chain that did not activate the Conjunction, as well as the first in the chain. This will turn all of the off states ($0$s) in the chain to on states $1$s, thereby sending the counter to its maximum value; then, the final pulse to the start of the chain makes the counter overflow, taking it back to $0$.

We can verify this by taking a look at the incremental counters, near one of these numbers:


```python
reset_modules(modules)
send_n_pulses(modules, 3730, reset=False, print_pulses=False)
for i in range(5):
    send_n_pulses(modules, 1, reset=False, print_pulses=False)
    print(f'======= Press {i+1} ======')
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_1']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_2']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_3']))
    print(binary_states(modules, clusters['chain_4']))
```

    ======= Press 1 ======
    111010010011
    111010010011
    111010010011

As expected, on the 3rd button press, the last of the incremental counters is zeroed; after this, it continues to count up from zero. This happens for all of the chains, at the number obtained from the modules in the chain connected to the `Conjunction` (i.e. 3793, 3947, 4057 or 3733).

So when is the final `rx` module activated? Only when each of these intermediate `Conjunction` modules is activated simultaneously. This happens when each of the incremental counters is reset at the same time - i.e. when the button has been hit a multiple of all of the chain numbers (i.e. 3793, 3947, 4057 or 3733). The first time that this happens must be the lowest common multiple of these numbers:


```python
math.lcm(4057, 3793, 3947, 3733)
```




    226732077152351



So the answer to part 2 of the puzzle is: __226732077152351__.
